description: Understand why you would want a connected / managed environment for
  AMPLIFY Central and Axway API Manager. Learn how you can govern and monitor
  the creation / deployment / publishing and subscriptions of AMPLIFY Central
  and Axway API Manager hosted APIs in one central location.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The Axway API Manager connectivity to AMPLIFY Central is currently available in an alpha review mode; current functionality and configuration may change before release. Therefore, this connectivity is available for trial use only and is not supported for production API management or connectivity.{{< /alert >}}

## What is Axway API Manager connected?

Connecting Axway API Manager (v7.6.2 or above) to AMPLIFY Central enables you to have a connected environment for Axway API Gateway where two agents (Discovery and Traceability) are used with Axway API Gateway to:

* Create a new API Gateway environment that can generate configurations for agents, allowing them to interact with AMPLIFY Central.
* Detect changes in API Manager deployments using the Discovery Agent. The Discovery Agent pushes the service configuration as an API service for the environment, which can then be published as a catalog item to be used by consumers to subscribe to the service.
* Create / Update a subscription in API Gateway that is associated with the service and API key and is used by AMPLIFY Central.
* Filter the Axway API Manager logs that are related to discovered APIs and prepare the transaction events that are sent to AMPLIFY platform.

### Discovery Agent

The Discovery Agent is used to discover new published API. The Discovery Agent pushes either an OAS3 or Swagger2 spec to AMPLIFY Central (depending on which was used to create the backend proxy in API Manager) or SOAP APIs.

The Discovery Agent discovers APIs that have PassTrough / API Key / OAuth security only.

The related APIs are published to AMPLIFY Central in either disconnected mode (catalog item publication) or connected mode (Environment / API Service publication and optionally as Catalog item). For additional information, see [Discovery Agent](/docs/central/connect-api-manager/deploy-your-agents/#discovery-agent).

### Traceability Agent

The Traceability Agent is used to filter the logs and prepare the transaction events that are sent to AMPLIFY Central.

## Minimum requirements

* An Axway AMPLIFY Central subscription in the AMPLIFYâ„¢ platform. See [Get started with AMPLIFY Central](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/central/quickstart/index.html).
* An AMPLIFY Central Service Account. See [Manage an API proxy using AMPLIFY CLI](/docs/central/cli_proxy_flow/)
* Axway API Manager / Axway API Gateway versions 7.6.2 SPx, 7.7 SPx or 7.8, up and running using a Linux installation (CentOS 6.x, 7.x, 8.x,  Oracle Linux 6.x, 7.x, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x, 7.x, 8.x,
  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.x, 12.x)
* The linux machine where API Manager & API Gateway are running should be accessible and have `sudo` rights to run the Agents.

## Connect Axway API Manager to AMPLIFY Central quickstart

1. Generate a key pair.

   * Create a new Service Account user in AMPLIFY Central using the key pair. See [Manage an API proxy using AMPLIFY CLI](/docs/central/cli_getstarted/).
2. Create an environment object in [AMPLIFY Central using the CLI](/docs/central/cli_environments/) or [Add your environment to AMPLIFY Central using the UI](/docs/central/mesh_management/add_env/#add-your-environment-to-amplify-central).
3. [Create a Discovery Agent configuration file](/docs/central/connect-api-manager/deploy-your-agents/#discovery-agent) *

   1. Move key files to a keys directory.
   2. Log into the Artifactory Repository and pull the latest binary of the Discovery Agent.
   3. Start the Discovery Agent.
4. [Create a Traceability Agent configuration file](/docs/central/connect-api-manager/deploy-your-agents/#traceability-agent) *

   1. Move key files to a keys directory.
   2. Log into the Artifactory Repository and pull the latest binary of the Traceability Agent.
   3. Start the Traceability Agent.
